# Title: EggstravaganzaNFT Contract Neglects Safe Minting Method

# Severity: High


## Summary

The `EggstravaganzaNFT` contract uses the `_mint` function instead of `_safeMint`, bypassing critical recipient checks when minting NFTs. This can result in NFTs being permanently lost if sent to a contract that cannot handle ERC721 tokens.

## Vulnerability Details

Vulnerability Exists in Line 29 of `EggstravaganzaNFT` Code: https://github.com/CodeHawks-Contests/2025-04-eggstravaganza/blob/main/src/EggstravaganzaNFT.sol#L29

`EggstravaganzaNFT` contract requires the caller; e.g: minter in `mintEgg` function to be the `EggHuntGame` contract which in return mints the token to the player address and whether the player address is an externally Owned Account or a contract; it's safer and recommended to check if the recipient is aware and can accept the ERC721 transfer or not.

Since `_mint` function does not check whether the recipient can properly handle ERC721 tokens, NFTs could be irreversibly lost.

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal {
        if (to == address(0)) {
            revert ERC721InvalidReceiver(address(0));
        }
        address previousOwner = _update(to, tokenId, address(0));
        if (previousOwner != address(0)) {
            revert ERC721InvalidSender(address(0));
        }
    }
````

By contrast, `_safeMint` function includes a check using onERC721Received, ensuring safe transfer:

```solidity
function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        ERC721Utils.checkOnERC721Received(_msgSender(), address(0), to, tokenId, data);
    }
````


## Impact

Despite the fact that the call sender `msg.sender` in `EggstravaganzaNFT` contract is the `EggHuntGame` contract, the fact that the actual receiver of the NFT is the player which may be a contract address; without implementing the acceptance check on the receiver address will result in permanently losing the NFT when minted to player.

## Tools Used

Manual and Visual Code Inspection

## Recommendations
Using _safeMint ensures compatibility and prevents accidental loss of NFTs due to non-compliant recipient contracts.

```solidity

function mintEgg(address to, uint256 tokenId) external returns (bool) {
        require(msg.sender == gameContract, "Unauthorized minter");
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        totalSupply += 1;
        return true;
    }
```
