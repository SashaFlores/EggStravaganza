# Title: `EggVault` Contract Miss Implemententation of `IERC721` Interface`

# Severity: High


## Summary

`EggVault` contract didn't implement `IERC721Receiver` interface by inheriting `ERC721Holder`, causing transferFrom operations to silently fail when NFTs are sent to it. This leads to permanent loss or locking of NFTs, breaking core game mechanics.


## Vulnerability Details

**According to the `ERC721 standard`, any smart contract meant to receive ERC721 tokens must implement the `onERC721Received` function, returning the correct selector. Failing to do so causes token transfers using `safeTransferFrom` to revert, or — if `transferFrom` is used (as in this case) — the token is transferred but gets permanently locked, because the recipient doesn’t acknowledge receipt.**

**How It Happens:**

* If the recipient is a smart contract, and it does not implement `onERC721Received`, the ERC721 token will be stuck.

* In the provided game logic, the `depositEggToVault` function transfers NFTs to the `EggVault` using `transferFrom`:

```solidity
eggNFT.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(eggVault), tokenId);
```


## Impact

* Permanent loss of user assets (egg NFTs).

* State inconsistency between vault and game logic.

* Player frustration and broken game experience.

* Reputational risk to protocol.

## Tools Used

Manual code review

ERC721 specification

## Recommendations

Implement the acceptance check properly by inheriting from OpenZeppelin's ERC721Holder:

```solidity
import {ERC721Holder} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/utils/ERC721Holder.sol";

contract EggVault is ERC721Holder {
    // Existing logic here
}
