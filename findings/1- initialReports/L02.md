# Title: Missing Access Control on `depositEgg` Allows Unauthorized Depositor Assignment

# Severity: Low


## Summary
The `depositEgg` function in the `EggVault` contract lacks proper access control, allowing any external caller to register an egg as deposited and assign an arbitrary depositor address. This could result in inconsistencies in game logic and misattribution of ownership.


## Vulnerability Details


The `depositEgg` function is marked `public` and can be called by anyone. While the contract checks that the NFT is already transferred to the vault and that it hasn't been deposited before, it does not restrict who can perform the call.

This means that a malicious actor could call the function before the legitimate game contract does, assigning themselves or another incorrect address as the `depositor` of a given token ID.

````solidity
function depositEgg(uint256 tokenId, address depositor) public {
    require(eggNFT.ownerOf(tokenId) == address(this), "NFT not transferred to vault");
    require(!storedEggs[tokenId], "Egg already deposited");
    storedEggs[tokenId] = true;
    eggDepositors[tokenId] = depositor;
    emit EggDeposited(depositor, tokenId);
}
````

## Proof of Concept

1. Attacker waits for a user to transfer an egg NFT to the vault via `depositEggToVault` in `EggHuntGame`.

2. Attacker front-runs the expected call to `depositEgg` by calling:

```solidity
eggVault.depositEgg(tokenId, attackerAddress);
```
3. The egg is now recorded as deposited by the attacker instead of the actual user, which can impact logic dependent on `eggDepositors`.

## Impact

* Incorrect attribution of egg ownership within the vault.

* Potential to disrupt reward systems, eligibility checks, or future logic based on the depositor field.

* No direct loss of funds or NFTs due to existence of ownerOf and duplicate guard checks.

This is a Low severity issue per CodeHawks standards, as it introduces a logic flaw and potential for misbehavior but does not endanger assets directly or indirectly.

## Recommendations

Restrict the `depositEgg` function so it can only be called by the game contract:
```solidity
address public gameContract;

modifier onlyGameContract() {
    require(msg.sender == gameContract, "Only game contract can call this");
    _;
}

function depositEgg(uint256 tokenId, address depositor) public onlyGameContract {
    require(eggNFT.ownerOf(tokenId) == address(this), "NFT not transferred to vault");
    require(!storedEggs[tokenId], "Egg already deposited");
    storedEggs[tokenId] = true;
    eggDepositors[tokenId] = depositor;
    emit EggDeposited(depositor, tokenId);
}
