# Title: Missing Time Check Allows Premature Game Termination in `EggHuntGame` contract.

# Severity: Medium


## Summary

The `endGame` function in the `EggHuntGame` contract allows the game owner to end the egg hunt at any time while the game is active, which can cause unexpected behavior that affect multiple users, even if they donâ€™t result in a direct loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Details

 https://github.com/CodeHawks-Contests/2025-04-eggstravaganza/blob/main/src/EggHuntGame.sol#L51

## Tools Used

* Manual and Visual Code Inspection.

* Forge Test 

## Proof of Concept

Test the `endGame` function to end earlier than `endTime`:

```solidity
function test_EndGameBeforeEndTime() public {
        
        uint256 current = block.timestamp;

        game.startGame(300);
        console.log("Game started at:", current);
        console.log("Game endTime:", game.endTime());


        // Check that the game is active and times are set.
        assertTrue(game.gameActive());
        assertEq(game.startTime(), current);
        assertEq(game.endTime(), current + 300);

        // Verify game status while active.
        string memory status = game.getGameStatus();
        assertEq(status, "Game is active");

        // Manipulate time to pass but not reach endTime
        vm.warp(100);

        // End the game.
        game.endGame();
        assertFalse(game.gameActive());

        status = game.getGameStatus();
        assertEq(status, "Game is not active");



        // Assert that the game was ended prematurely
        assertFalse(game.gameActive());
        console.log("Game ended at:", block.timestamp);
        if (block.timestamp < game.endTime()) {
            console.log("Game ended before endTime");
        }
    }
``````


The test passes and owner succeeded in ending the game prematurely

```bash
[PASS] test_EndGameBeforeEndTime() (gas: 86361)
Logs:
  Game started at: 1
  Game endTime: 301
  Game ended at: 100
  Game ended before endTime
```


## Impact

**This vulnerability enables the owner to prematurely terminate the game, which can:**

* Prevent players from continuing to find eggs within the expected timeframe.

* Disrupt gameplay and reduce fairness for participants.

* Violate trust assumptions about game integrity.

* Potentially result in fewer NFTs being minted or collected than players anticipated.

While no funds are at risk, the fairness and core logic of the NFT-based game are significantly compromised.

## Recommendations

Update the `endGame` function to enforce that the current block timestamp has reached or passed the declared `endTime`:

```solidity
function endGame() external onlyOwner {
    require(gameActive, "Game not active");
    require(block.timestamp >= endTime, "Game not yet finished");
    gameActive = false;
    emit GameEnded(block.timestamp);
}
````
